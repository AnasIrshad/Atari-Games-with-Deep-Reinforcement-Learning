# Atari-Games-with-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

Deep Learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw envirnment data from the game and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards based on which actions are taken in the game.
